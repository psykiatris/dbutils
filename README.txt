Just a readme.

For developers: The proposed package is used to work on future code,
without disrupting the current package flow. When a class is completed and
is ready to put in the program, it will be moved to the appropiate folder.
Classes will appear and disappear from this package and ideas are coded and
 discarded.

 It should not be included in distribution.

 Letting you know. :)
